<p>I drive a 1988 Honda Prelude. I'm not certain of it's history, but I do know it spent a long time on Bribie island and in turn has gotten pretty rusty. Looking back on some photos from when I bought it, there was a good chunk on the rear passenger quarter already rusting, which I have left for two years, and now looks terrible. Here I'll document how I &quot;&quot;&quot;fix&quot;&quot;&quot; it.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Rust</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have some pretty bad rust patches on the rear passenger quarter (below the fuel door),</p>
<p><img src="/images/rust-slowdown/beforeQuarter.jpeg" alt="" /> <img src="/images/rust-slowdown/beforeQuarterZoom.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
<p>and a patch on the bonnet where the paint chipped up in a heavy storm,</p>

<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>n.b. I did the following process for the rear quarter and bonnet but only will show pics of the quarter.</p>
<p>Started by sanding down to bare metal with 120 and 220 grit sandpaper,</p>
<p><img src="/images/rust-slowdown/sandQuarter.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Then paint with (a <em>lot</em> of) rust converter and wait about 30 minutes to dry.</p>
<p><img src="/images/rust-slowdown/convertQuarter.jpeg" alt="" />
<img src="/images/rust-slowdown/converQuarterZoom.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Finally, mask and paint. Did about 4 coats of paint.

<p>Yeah, look, it's not great, but it is better than having metal exposed to the air, and in all fairness is better than when I bought it (2.5 years ago...). Needs a lot more work but this will do for the meantime, and I can get back to commuting.</p>
<h3 id="retrospective">Retrospective</h3>
<p>Realistically, in the future I should/will need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>strip back way more paint in case (pretty sure I am) missing rust</li>
<li>rust convert a few layers</li>
<li>bondo/body filler</li>
<li>sand smooth</li>
<li>more body filler</li>
<li>sand smooth</li>
<li>primer</li>
<li>sand</li>
<li>paint</li>
<li>wet sand</li>
<li>polish, wax, ceramic coat seal, etc etc</li>
</ol>
<p>but that is looking like a solid long-weekend/holiday project, rather than one afternoon and one morning.</p>
<h2 id="bonus">Bonus</h2>
<p>Also, while the car was in the garage already for the paint to dry, I thought I'd try adjusting my door - it never quite closed properly.</p>
<p>To adjust the door position, I need to adjust the hinges. To get to the hinges, I need to remove the front quarter. To remove the quarter, I need to remove the bumper. To remove the bumper, I need to remove the plastic skid tray thing. In short, my &quot;30 minute fix&quot; turned in to dismantling half the car.</p>
<p>But it worked! I had to jack up the door (literally - used a car jack) to have it sit slightly higher than the door latch, so when it would sag under it's own weight, it would actually close properly.</p>
