Today I went to the city for a "quick and easy ride". Finished the day riding the furthest I've ever ridden!

Accidentally recorded some of the train trip - see how smooth the path gets near the end?

## Retrospective
Very tired night of, but felt good the next day. My working theory is that the few km to and from the station to start and end the ride (which I'm not exactly taking easy - there's a solid hill going *to* the station, and on the way home I like to race back down the hills) do a great job for warm-up and cool-down on these city rides.

Recorded a total of 43.83km of riding. There was also some mucking around from the Shorncliffe station up to the cliff, down to the jetty, along to a cafe, back to the Woolworths for sunscreen... you get the idea. So I *suspect* we did 50km total, *but* we might've come up slightly short. A more officially-50km-long ride may be in order.
